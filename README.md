# stoPProcrastinating
For Windows 10 because I still don't use linux at home

## What it does
- `work.c` should be run when working and keeps track of how much time is spent working
- `killer.c` runs on startup to kill any specified programs when they are launched (i.e. video games)
    - stops killing if a certain amount of time has been spent working
